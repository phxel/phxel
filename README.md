### the name sunflowerField was taken so i had to make due

i’m a developer who enjoys making things work, breaking them, and then figuring out how to fix them again. i primarily work with go and occasionally take a detour into java or rust if i feel fancy.

#### a few things about me:
- go enthusiast – because life is too short for complicated package management.
- i make things, break things, and hope it all adds up in the end.

#### in my spare time:
- i ponder the nature of reality and meaning, often while troubleshooting code.
- i sometimes wonder why something doesn't work five minutes after i've fixed it.
