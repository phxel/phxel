### The name "sunflowerField" was taken, so I had to make do.

I’m a developer who enjoys making things work, breaking them, and figuring out how to fix them again. I primarily work with Go and occasionally take a detour into Java or Rust when I'm feeling fancy.

#### A few things about me:
- Go enthusiast – because life is too short for complicated package management.
- I make things, break things, and hope it all adds up in the end.
